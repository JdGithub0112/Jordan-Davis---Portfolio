## Welcome to the Python Competitions section of my Portfolio
I am currently enrolled in one data science Python competition and have been actively working on it. Each of the project(s) has its own Jupyter notebook where I document my progress, methodology, and results.

### Competitions
### DataCamp: Predicting Hotel Cancellations[](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/predict-hotel-cancellation)
In this competition, the goal is to predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the overall condition of the house. I have been using various regression models such as linear regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression to predict the house prices. You can find my Jupyter notebook for this project here.


### Conclusion
These are just a few of the data science Python competitions that I am currently enrolled in. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my data science skills. If you have any suggestions or recommendations for other competitions that I should participate in, feel free to reach out to me.
