## ‚ú® Welcome to the Python Competitions section of my Portfolio!
I am currently enrolled in one data science Python competition and have been actively working on it. Each of the project(s) has its own Jupyter notebook where I document my progress, methodology, and results.

### Competitions:

### üè® [DataCamp - Predicting Hotel Cancellations](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/predict-hotel-cancellation)
You are supporting a hotel with a project aimed to increase revenue from their room bookings. They believe that they can use data science to help them reduce the number of cancellations. This is where you come in! They have asked you to use any appropriate methodology to identify what contributes to whether a booking will be fulfilled or cancelled. They intend to use the results of your work to reduce the chance someone cancels their booking.


### Conclusion
These are just a few of the data science Python competitions that I am currently enrolled in. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my data science skills. If you have any suggestions or recommendations for other competitions that I should participate in, feel free to reach out to me.
