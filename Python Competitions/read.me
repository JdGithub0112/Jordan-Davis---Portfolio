## Enrolled in Data Science Python Competitions
I am currently enrolled in several data science Python competitions and have been actively working on them. Each of the projects has its own Jupyter notebook where I document my progress, methodology, and results.

Competitions
Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
In this competition, the goal is to predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the overall condition of the house. I have been using various regression models such as linear regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression to predict the house prices. You can find my Jupyter notebook for this project here.

DrivenData: Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table
The goal of this competition is to predict which water pumps in Tanzania are functional, which need repairs, and which don't work at all. I have been using various classification models such as logistic regression, random forest classification, and support vector machines to classify the water pumps. You can find my Jupyter notebook for this project here.

Analytics Vidhya: Loan Prediction
In this competition, the goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on various features such as the applicant's income, credit history, and loan amount. I have been using various classification models such as logistic regression, random forest classification, and support vector machines to predict the loan approvals. You can find my Jupyter notebook for this project here.

Conclusion
These are just a few of the data science Python competitions that I am currently enrolled in. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my data science skills. If you have any suggestions or recommendations for other competitions that I should participate in, feel free to reach out to me.
