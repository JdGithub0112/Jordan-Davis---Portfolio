### Pandas Project
#### *Wrangling, joining, and cleaning World Health Organization Data for analysis and visualization*
In this project I wanted to demonstrate my contempency on using Pandas for organizing and cleaning my data to end up with a dataframe for analysis. In this scenario, I wanted to learn how to scrape data from the web to have up-to-date information for my plots. The data in question comes from the World Health Organization and displays Covid cases/deaths data since early 2020 (cadence for update is everyday).

I began my explaratory data analysis by web scraping data from the [Statistics Times Website](https://statisticstimes.com/geography/countries-by-continents.php) for country data
