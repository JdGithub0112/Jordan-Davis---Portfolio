<h1>Python Projects Detail</h1>

### Welcome to my GitHub Python Project Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in data exploration and analysis using Python.

#### Mushroom Project
In the mushroom_analysis folder, you can find two .py files that perform data exploration and analysis on the Mushroom dataset.

.py files:

[Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/JdGithub0112/Jordan-Davis-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20Projects/mushroom_Classification_ExploratoryAnalysis.py)

[K Nearest Neighbor Classification Model](https://github.com/JdGithub0112/Jordan-Davis-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20Projects/mushroom_Classification_Model.py)

mushroom_data_exploration.py: This script explores the Mushroom dataset, which contains information about various types of mushrooms. The script uses the Pandas library to load and clean the data, and then creates visualizations to help understand the data.
mushroom_data_analysis.py: This script performs analysis on the Mushroom dataset, using statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis. The script also creates visualizations to help interpret the results.
COVID-19 Data Exploration
In the covid_data_exploration folder, you can find a single .py file that performs data exploration on COVID-19 data. The file is:


#### Covid-19 Project
covid_data_exploration.py: This script explores the COVID-19 dataset, which contains information about the number of cases and deaths in various countries. The script uses the Pandas library to load and clean the data, and then creates visualizations to help understand the data.
